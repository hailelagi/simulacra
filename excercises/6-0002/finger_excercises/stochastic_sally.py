Sally averages 5 strokes a hole when she plays golf. One day, she
took 40 strokes to complete the first nine holes. Her partner conjectured
that she would probably regress to the mean and take 50 strokes to complete
the next nine holes. Do you agree with her partner?
"""

"""
No -
Regression to the mean would imply that the likelihood of the next 5 strokes
in each set of 50 strokes is more likely to be a hole, not necessarily that 50 
strokes would more likely result in 10 holes.
